# FoodApp
My food spread sheet but as a program. Woah.
Ideal functionality:

GUI that allows you to add foods to a database with their macros and prices.
Create meals with foods from the database, figure out daily calories, cost per portion, cost for the day, etc.
Have a section of the program where you can input your inventory, and based off your designed meal plan, will tell
  you how much of each food to buy.
Calculate price per item, total price, etc. 
Ideally it would also even add those items to your shopping cart, so you can go and order them with little hassle. 

Current functionality as of 1-20-2020:
Text user interface that interacts with a database of foods (imported from my spreadsheet). Add, delete, sort, view foods. 
Still need to reimplement search and update functionality (this functionality exists for interacting with .txt file but not database)
