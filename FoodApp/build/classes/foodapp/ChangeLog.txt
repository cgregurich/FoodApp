1-3-20:
-added printFileFormatted to FoodFile (prints a formatted chart instead of repetitive info)
-added method updateFood, updateGetInfo, updateMultipleResults to TextUserInterface


1-4-20:
-TextUserInterface: update functionality now has validation on multiple levels
    can deal with multiple results for the given name
**WHY DOES UPDATE DUPLICATE????:
    because you were pulling a FoodItem by ref and altering an attribute, then 
    calling an updateFood method of FoodFile that inserted a new food.
    thinking that it would insert and replace at param index but instead
    inserted at index and pushed everything by one.
**work on formatted output in chart style instead of title: info repeating
**functionality to update food info
    **-get update to work (currently duplicates but updates??)
    -validate user entry in multiple areas
    -deal with multiple results
-updated addFood in TextUserInterface to be less repetitive
-added escape clause to all (i think) functions
formatted output across the program
-del and update deal with non number input when asking which multiple result to del/update
