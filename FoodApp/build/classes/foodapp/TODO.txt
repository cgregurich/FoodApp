TODO:

work on formatted output in chart style instead of title: info repeating

create text user interface
    -displays command menu
    -prompts user for command
    -calls method based on command           (like NameFileApp)
    -methods:
        add (add food item to file; prompts for all stats; validate unit choices? enum? probably!)
        remove (remove food item from file, based on name; remove all with name or first? probably!)
        view (view all in file)
        search (search for foods containing keyword in name?)
      

add in text user interface delete() functionality to see how many items have a name
and to ask user to delete all or not? prob need a search method before this
        
        


-add functionality to do math with food stats
    eg. enter food name to choose food, then enter how many units to display
    so if I enter oats then 80, it'll display macros for 80g instead of a serving size

-figure out GUI???

-crazy functionality that allows me to calculate my daily macros and shish
    
DONE:


create food item class
    -create fields
    -create getters for all fields
    -create setters for all fields
    
create file access class (implements DAO)

create DAO interface
    -getAll: reads file and puts each food item on a list, returns list
    -add: adds a new food item to file (specifically: writes food item to list then runs save() )
    -delete: deletes a food item from file if it exists (specifically: removes food item from list if it's on list then 
        runs save() )
    -save: writes all food items in list to file
