TODO:



-SPLIT Update into more methods (ugly code rn!)

-split deleteMultipleFoods into multiple methods


MATH FUNCTIONALITY!!!!

-sorting functionality. Sort by name (a-z or z-a) sort by SS (useless?), 
    by unit, cals, carbs, fat, etc.

-make a replace method in FoodFileDAO to deal with sorting 
    maybe even just make pop() from python to return the removed Object

-in the future when prices are added (??) include $ per calories as well as by price.





SORTING:
    *?-need to deal with converting stats to int if needed, sorting numbers 
    as strings DOES NOT WORK RIGHT (only looks at first char as a str)

-output food items after sorting (rn user has to call for view again)

-give option of ascending or descending (or a-z / z-a in the case of unit and name)

-add validation for int stats to only take ints (to avoid issues with sorting)










-prices and grocery functionality

-somehow pull info from online for macros instead of manually entering? LOL


        
        


-add functionality to do math with food stats
    eg. enter food name to choose food, then enter how many units to display
    so if I enter oats then 80, it'll display macros for 80g instead of a serving size

-figure out GUI???

-crazy functionality that allows me to calculate my daily macros and shish
    
DONE:


create food item class
    -create fields
    -create getters for all fields
    -create setters for all fields
    
create file access class (implements DAO)

create DAO interface
    -getAll: reads file and puts each food item on a list, returns list
    -add: adds a new food item to file (specifically: writes food item to list then runs save() )
    -delete: deletes a food item from file if it exists (specifically: removes food item from list if it's on list then 
        runs save() )
    -save: writes all food items in list to file

create text user interface
    **-displays command menu
    **-prompts user for command
    **-calls method based on command           (like NameFileApp)
    -methods:
        **add (add food item to file; prompts for all stats; validate unit choices? enum? probably!)
        **remove (remove food item from file, based on name; remove all with name or first? probably!)
        **view (view all in file)
        **search (search for foods containing keyword in name?)

**search functionality needs to be less specific
      

**add in text user interface delete() functionality to see how many items have a name
**and to ask user to delete all or not? prob need a **search method before this

**WHY DOES UPDATE DUPLICATE????:
    because you were pulling a FoodItem by ref and altering an attribute, then 
    calling an updateFood method of FoodFile that inserted a new food.
    thinking that it would insert and replace at param index but instead
    inserted at index and pushed everything by one.

**work on formatted output in chart style instead of title: info repeating

functionality to update food info
    **-get update to work (currently duplicates but updates??)
    -validate user entry in multiple areas
    -deal with multiple results

**X TO LEAVE:
    **add
    **-del
    **-update
    **-search

*?*implement formatted output in all areas of the program (delete for example)

**-add cancel functionality to all (if needed) options in the program (to avoid spam input)
**-also to avoid having to make a choice eg. deleting one of same name entries (want to delete none!)

**-del and update (which one clause) needs to deal with non number entry

1-6-20

**-change output of multiple search results found to formatted ouput



**change output from ss and unit separate to ss and unit combined (example: serving size 32g)

**-give user multiple chances to enter food to delete (when enter name that doesnt exist)
    idk if necessary

**-FIX BUG: when using x clause in update when prompted for new value for stat, 
    the stat becomes x
