1-3-20:
-added printFileFormatted to FoodFile (prints a formatted chart instead of repetitive info)
-added method updateFood, updateGetInfo, updateMultipleResults to TextUserInterface


1-4-20:
-TextUserInterface: update functionality now has validation on multiple levels
    can deal with multiple results for the given name
**WHY DOES UPDATE DUPLICATE????:
    because you were pulling a FoodItem by ref and altering an attribute, then 
    calling an updateFood method of FoodFile that inserted a new food.
    thinking that it would insert and replace at param index but instead
    inserted at index and pushed everything by one.
**work on formatted output in chart style instead of title: info repeating
**functionality to update food info
    **-get update to work (currently duplicates but updates??)
    -validate user entry in multiple areas
    -deal with multiple results
-updated addFood in TextUserInterface to be less repetitive
-added escape clause to all (i think) functions
formatted output across the program
-del and update deal with non number input when asking which multiple result to del/update

1-6-20:
Search results are now formatted chart output
Update and Delete now reprompt user when receives bad input
Chart puts unit on the end of the serving size instead of its own column
Split Update method into more methods (updateGetChoice, updateGetNewStat).
    Original updateFood method calls these new methods; cleaner code.
Renamed updateGetInfo to updateGetFoodToUpdate (more descriptive)
